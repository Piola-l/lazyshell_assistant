# Asshole AI Assistant written in python

It's an AI Linux assistant powered by [Google Gemini Flash Lite 2.0](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free) and using OpenRouter free API because i'm poor. I've tried using LLaMA 3.2 but my PC is potato.

Supports **gnome-terminal** and **phyxis** terminal, but you can easily add yours!

You can configure it in _settings.json_
